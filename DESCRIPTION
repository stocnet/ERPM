Description: Simulates and estimates the Exponential Random Partition Model presented
    in the paper Hoffman, Block, and Snijders (2023) <doi:10.1177/00811750221145166>.
    It can also be used to estimate longitudinal partitions, following the model
    proposed in Hoffman and Chabot (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2023.04.002>.
    The model is an exponential family distribution on the space of partitions
    (sets of non-overlapping groups) and is called in reference to the Exponential
    Random Graph Models (ERGM) for networks.
