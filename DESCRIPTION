Description: This package can be used to simulate and estimate the Exponential Random Partition Model presented in the paper Hoffman, Block, and Snijders, 2023.
It can also be used to estimate longitudinal partitions, following the model proposed in Hoffman and Chabot, 2023.
The model is an exponential family distribution on the space of partitions (sets of non-overlapping groups) and is called in reference to the Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) for networks.
