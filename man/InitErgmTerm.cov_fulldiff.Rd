\title{ERGM term: cov_fulldiff (within-group range of a numeric covariate)}
\usage{
InitErgmTerm.cov_fulldiff(nw, arglist, ..., version = packageVersion("ergm"))
}
\description{
\code{cov_fulldiff} is an ERGM term for bipartite networks that measures,
for each group, the dispersion of a numeric actor covariate through the
max–min range, optionally restricted to a subset of group sizes.

The bipartite network is interpreted as:
\itemize{
\item an \emph{actor mode} (the side identified by \code{nw \%n\% "bipartite"});
\item a \emph{group mode} (the complementary side, representing groups).
}

Each actor in the actor mode carries a numeric covariate value \eqn{x_i}. For
each group node, we look at the actors adjacent to that group and compute
the within-group range \eqn{x_g^{\max} - x_g^{\min}}. An optional \code{size}
filter restricts which group sizes contribute to the statistic.
}
\details{
The term is implemented as a native ERGM C change-statistic, declared in the
compiled code under a symbol compatible with \code{name = "cov_fulldiff"}.
The R initializer below:
\itemize{
\item enforces that the network is bipartite via \code{nw \%n\% "bipartite"};
\item extracts an actor-level covariate from a vertex attribute or from a
literal vector, coercing it to numeric and failing fast on \code{NA};
\item normalizes the optional \code{size} argument into a sorted set of
strictly positive integers;
\item packs the actor covariate and the size filter into a compact
\code{INPUT_PARAM} vector for the C layer.
}

The ERGM infrastructure will call the C change-statistic whenever a toggle
affects an edge between an actor and a group. The C code then recomputes the
local contribution of the affected group(s) to the total max–min range.
}
\note{
InitErgmTerm.cov_fulldiff.R

The network must be strictly bipartite:
\itemize{
\item the actor mode size is given by \code{nw \%n\% "bipartite"} and must be
a positive integer;
\item the group mode is the complementary set of nodes;
\item the covariate is read on the actor mode only.
}

The covariate is coerced to numeric if possible (logical and integer types
are accepted), and any \code{NA} on the actor mode is rejected in a
fail-fast manner. The \code{size} argument, if supplied, must contain
strictly positive integers; a zero-length \code{size} vector is considered
invalid and should be replaced by \code{NULL}.

Internally, \code{cov_fulldiff} passes the size filter and the actor
covariate to the C layer through \code{INPUT_PARAM} with layout
\code{c(n1, L, sizes[1:L], x[1:n1])}.

\section{Mathematical definition}{

Let:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{A} be the set of actor-mode nodes;
\item \eqn{G} be the set of group-mode nodes;
\item \eqn{B} the bipartite adjacency between actors and groups;
\item \eqn{x_i \in \mathbb{R}} the numeric covariate value of actor
\eqn{i \in A};
\item \eqn{A_g = \{ i \in A : B_{ig}=1\}} the set of actors in group
\eqn{g \in G};
\item \eqn{n_g = |A_g|} the size of group \eqn{g};
\item \eqn{S} the set of allowed group sizes, derived from the
\code{size} argument (\eqn{S = \mathbb{N}^*} if \code{size = NULL}).
}

Define, for each group \eqn{g \in G} with \eqn{n_g \ge 1},
\deqn{
  x_g^{\max} = \max_{i \in A_g} x_i,
  \qquad
  x_g^{\min} = \min_{i \in A_g} x_i.
}
The statistic is
\deqn{
  T(B;x)
  =
  \sum_{g \in G}
    \mathbf{1}[\,n_g \in S\,]
    \bigl(x_g^{\max} - x_g^{\min}\bigr),
}
i.e. the sum of within-group ranges of the covariate, restricted to group
sizes in \eqn{S}. When \code{size = NULL}, \eqn{S} is the set of all
positive integers and every non-empty group contributes.
}

\section{Usage}{

Typical usage with {ergm} on a bipartite network \code{nw}:
\preformatted{
  # Range of a numeric actor covariate within each group (all group sizes)
  summary(nw ~ cov_fulldiff(cov = "x_attr"))

  # Restrict to groups of size 3 or 4
  summary(nw ~ cov_fulldiff(cov = "x_attr", size = c(3, 4)))
}

When using the ERPM wrapper on a partition-based workflow, the term can be
invoked indirectly as:
\preformatted{
  erpm(partition ~ cov_fulldiff(cov = "x_attr", size = 2:5))
}
provided that the wrapper translates the partition into a bipartite network
with a consistent actor mode and group mode.
}

\section{Tests}{

Self-tests for \code{cov_fulldiff} construct small bipartite networks with
known group memberships and numeric covariates, and compare:
\itemize{
\item the ERGM summary \code{summary(nw ~ cov_fulldiff(...))};
\item direct evaluations of
\eqn{\sum_g \mathbf{1}[n_g \in S] (x_g^{\max} - x_g^{\min})}
for various choices of the size filter \eqn{S}.
}
Additional checks verify that toggling an actor–group tie updates the
statistic by the expected local change in the max–min range of the affected
group, including cases where the group becomes empty or changes size.
