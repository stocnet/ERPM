\arguments{
\item{theta}{model parameters}

\item{current.partitions}{XXX}

\item{current.logit}{XXX}

\item{current.z.contributions}{XXX}

\item{current.z}{XXX}

\item{presence.tables}{matrix indicating which actors were present for each observations (mandatory)}

\item{nodes}{node set (data frame)}

\item{effects}{effects/sufficient statistics (list with a vector "names", and a vector "objects")}

\item{objects}{objects used for statistics calculation (list with a vector "name", and a vector "object")}

\item{neighborhood}{way of choosing partitions: probability vector (2 actors swap, merge/division, single actor move, single pair move, 2 pairs swap, 2 groups reshuffle)}

\item{sizes.allowed}{vector of group sizes allowed in sampling (now, it only works for vectors like size_min:size_max)}

\item{sizes.simulated}{vector of group sizes allowed in the Markov chain but not necessraily sampled (now, it only works for vectors like size_min:size_max)}
